Inter-University Network Setup using RIP and NAT
This project is a simulation of network infrastructure between three universities: GUB, BUET, and KUET using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each university has three devices (server, PC, laptop), and the routing is done using RIP v2 along with NAT configuration for external communication.

🔧 Technologies & Tools
Cisco Packet Tracer
RIP (Routing Information Protocol v2)
NAT (Network Address Translation)
🧠 What I Learned
How to set up and test dynamic routing using RIP.
First-time experience with serial cable connections.
Troubleshooting NAT — had to dig a bit using ChatGPT and the internet 😅.
